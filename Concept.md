Concept

Threats to individuals lead to the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as tax
payer data, Social Security numbers, credit and debit card information, or medical records. The disclosure of such information could cause harm to individuals,including identity theft, financial loss, and embarrassment.

Typical threats include the following (US GAO 2011):
• A bot-network operator which uses a network, or bot-net, of compromised, remotely controlled systems to coordinate attacks and to distribute phishing schemes, spam, and malware attacks.
• Criminal groups which attack systems for monetary gain. Specifically, organized
criminal groups use spam, phishing, and spyware/malware to commit
identity theft, online fraud, and computer extortion.
• International corporate spies and criminal organizations which conduct industrial
espionage and large-scale monetary theft and to hire or develop hacker
talent.
• Hackers who break into networks for the thrill of the challenge, bragging rights
in the hacker community, revenge, stalking, monetary gain, and political activism,
among other reasons. Hackers can now download attack scripts and
protocols from the Internet and launch them against victim sites. Attack tools
have become much more sophisticated, and easier to use.
• A disgruntled organization insider which is a principal source of computer
crime. The insider threat includes contractors hired by the organization, as well
as careless or poorly trained employees who may inadvertently introduce malware
into systems.
• Nations which use cyber tools as part of their information-gathering and espionage
activities.
• Phishers who are individuals or small groups that execute phishing schemes to
steal identities or information for monetary gain. Phishers may also use spam
and spyware or malware to accomplish their objectives.
• Spammers who are individuals or organizations that distribute unsolicited e-mail
with hidden or false information in order to sell products, conduct phishing
schemes, distribute spyware or malware, or attack organizations (e.g., a denial of
service).
• Spyware or malware authors who are individuals or organizations with malicious
intent carrying out attacks against users by producing and distributing
spyware and malware.
• Terrorists who seek to destroy, incapacitate, or exploit critical infrastructures in
order to threaten national security, cause mass casualties, weaken the economy,

The course is designed for technically minded people who want to protect
themselves from hackers, cyber criminals, malware, viruses. It's for people who want
to share information anonymously without endangering themselves or their family.
It's for those who want to keep their accounts, email, communication, and personal
information private from corporate or government tracking and spying.

It's also for those with an interest in technology and the internet, like security
professionals, students studying IT or security. Also for freedom fighters, political or
religious dissidents operating in oppressive regimes, journalists, businessmen and
women where security, privacy, and anonymity matters. Also law enforcement
officers and other agents who need a better understanding of how criminals avoid
detection. It's also for those who care about government spying on their internet
usage and want to avoid it.
It's for law enforcement officers who are operating in hostile environments or
undercover. And for those who wish to publish information anonymously, like whistle
blowers, bloggers in countries with laws on the content of what they can write, and
anyone who has an interest in security, privacy, and anonymity and wants to learn
more.

Maintaining security, privacy, and anonymity can be a complex thing. In order to
achieve good security, good privacy, and to be anonymous, you must understand
detail, so the course goes in-depth. It is both broad and in-depth. Any course that just
touches on the surface of security will leave gaps, and any gap makes you vulnerable.
So any course that attempts to help protect you online has to have some depth and
breadth to it, or it would fail to teach you enough so you can protect yourself online.
But just because the topic is in-depth and complex doesn’t mean it's not possible to
learn. If you find the topic interesting, then that's all you'll need

According to a psychology report, learners retain approximately 90% of what they
learn when they teach someone else or if they use it immediately. Which is why I
recommend you learn it from the perspective that you're going to teach someone else,
or actually teach someone else, and you set up the test environment so you can use
these things immediately.

Protect your valuable asset

The aim should be to protect what you value most and apply enough security so
you can do the things that you want to do, safely online. Consider your accounts,
files, email, websites you visit, etc. now, and ask yourself, "What is most confidential
to me?" What can't you afford to lose? What is irreplaceable? What could cause you
the most damage? What might impact your reputation?

Think about if they were stolen, destroyed, or encrypted so you couldn’t use them,
placed on the internet, put in the hands of a criminal. Now make a list of these things
and how much you really care about them.

So the purpose of this is to spend most of your effort on the things that you value
and the things that you care about, and spend much less effort wasting time on the
things that you really don’t care about or can be replaced quite easily

Asset

In the context of cybersecurity, the term refers to any organizational information resource that may
be subject to cyber-attack and which is therefore in need of protection. The term can cover a wide range of resources such as data resources, software, physical computer systems, networks, utilities, and even less tangible resources such as reputation or community standing.

In the context of cyber security, the information assets may have one or more security requirements. The three most common requirements are those typically referred to as confidentiality, integrity, and vailability.

Confidentiality

Confidentiality of an information asset refers to the asset (or its contents) only being known to those authorized by the asset owner.

Examples of information assets to be protected could be proprietary information, customer data, and employee data. For example, confidentiality of stored data might be achieved by implementing
encryption of an individual file containing the data, the database, or the entire disk.

BitLocker

 is a full-disk encryption tool built into the Windows
operating system.1 It supports Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128-and
256-bit encryption, and it is primarily used for whole-disk encryption

IPsec

confidentiality of data
can be protected during transmission by enforcing data encryption protocols such as
the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). IPSec is an Internet Protocol (IP) suite for
securing communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a
communication session

Integrity

The integrity of an asset is adversely affected if the asset is altered incorrectly. For
example, the information contained in a database may be altered by accidental
corruption (perhaps due to partial storage failure) or by the deliberate unauthorized
actions of an individual or individuals.

Whether the cause is accidental or deliberate,
protecting the integrity of an information asset from unauthorized or unintended
modification is an essential component of cyber security

For example, a
customer can be overcharged if the integrity of billing information is not protected.
A cyber-attacker might compromise system integrity leading to unintended operations
of pumps and valves resulting in damage to both information and
non-information assets. Integrity at the source can be protected by implementing
access controls, process controls, and configuration management. Integrity during
data transmission can be achieved by implementing hashing algorithms or cyclic
redundancy checks (CRC) to detect corruption.

Availability

The availability of an information asset is the ability to provide reliable and timely
access to information assets to authorized individuals.

For example, redundant array
of independent disks (RAID) technology is commonly used in data storage to
combine multiple hard-drive components into a single logical unit. If one hard drive

fails, the data is still available for use. Computer networks and system have a
plethora of equipment and software that must all work in concert to ensure the data
is available to authorized individuals.

Privacy

So privacy is nobody seeing what you do, but potentially knowing who you are.Privacy is about content, privacy is about maintaining confidentiality and keeping
secrets.

Another example, if you register with a cloud storage provider such as Dropbox,
you are not anonymous, but if you encrypt the files and only you have the key, the
data is private, you have privacy.

You are private in your own home, as no one knows what you do in your home, you
are not anonymous, as everyone knows that you live there.

Anonymity

Anonymity is nobody knowing who you are, but potentially seeing what you do.
Anonymity is keeping your actions and activities separate from your true identity.
Anonymity concerns your identity, anonymity is when, out of a set of all possible
people, there is an equal chance it could be anyone.

You may desire this for viewing content, but not for making it, it depends.
Anonymity means non attribution to your actions, to be nameless, to be faceless.
One example, you connect to the internet through an anonymizing service like Tor
and post a message about women's rights under an anonymous username, maybe in a
country where that's a crime. Your identity remains anonymous and separate from
your true identity but your message is received and not private, this is anonymity.
If you connect to a website via a virtual private network, you are potentially
anonymous to that website, but when you post a message on their public forum, that
message is not private.

And finally, there's a variant of anonymity people sometimes use and that is
pseudo-anonymity. Pseudo-anonymity is when you wish to retain a reputation against
an identity. A common example is having an alias for social media or for a forum
online. And this picture sums it up.An adversary may not know who the blue bag user is but they can attribute posts
and activities to him or her. This is an alias, a cover, a false identity

One of the more interesting pseudonyms of modern times is Satoshi Nakamoto, the
creator of Bitcoin. If you're not familiar with who he is, that's a little extra reading you
can do for fun.

Risk Assessment Terminology



Security

So this means that security is the degree to which our assets are resistant to threats
from our adversaries. And we select security controls based on the type of threats and
adversaries that we face

Threats - Vitisho

are the bad things that can happen, like a malware attack, like mass
surveillance, like exploit kits, like the reading of encryption, and a virus infection, and
the others that you can see here.

adversaries

And these threats, they're enabled by our adversaries, which might be hackers,
cyber criminals, nation-states, oppressive regimes, and maybe something like your expartner,
if you're unlucky.

Risk - Hatari

The likelihood of threats exploiting vulnerabilities in your security controls and the consequences of that is known as risk. Risk to your assets, the risk to you, the risk to your privacy and anonymity.

vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities- Udhaifu

A vulnerability is a weakness in an asset’s protections such that a threat source may
be able to adversely affect the security requirements (confidentiality, integrity or
availability) of an asset.
Consider a basic threat to an information asset such as a computer. A computer
behind a locked door may be considered to be less likely to be stolen than one
which is in an open area. In this case, the lack of a locked door is a vulnerability
which may result in a breach of the asset’s availability. Likewise, a locked but weak
door may be considered to leave an asset more vulnerable than a locked sturdy
door.

A vulnerability is something that one or more threat sources can exploit to negatively
impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an asset

And you can also see here these red triangles, these represent vulnerabilities, bugs,
and weaknesses in your security controls. A threat will try to exploit vulnerabilities in
your security to impact your assets. For example, malware infecting your computer
through the vulnerability of being unpatched.

And the threats and adversaries that you face, these are called your threat
landscape, or your threat model. Your threat landscape will be individual to you.
In the section on "Know Your Enemy", we will better understand the threats and
adversaries that are out there so you can assess what your individual threat landscape
is, although we will share a lot of common threats and adversaries such as hackers,
cyber criminals and so on. But we may not all have an unfortunate ex-partner.
RISK = (Vulnerability x Threats x Consequences)

Know Yourself - The Threat and Vulnerability Landscape
So as you can clearly see, security does absolutely not exist in isolation, there is not
a one size fits all solution. Your security controls should be selected based on their
ability to mitigate your perceived threats and adversaries, and the consequences of
that realization.
For example, you might select Tor as a security control to help mitigate against
mass surveillance, the threat of mass surveillance, from an oppressive regime. And
you might choose Tor because the consequences are high in terms of your identity,
and once your identity is known, the consequences will be realized.
So you must implement security controls to protect your assets, to ensure privacy
and anonymity and pseudo-anonymity if you require it.
Security is a technology, security is also an action and is also a process. It's very
important to understand that security controls are not just technology, you must
understand that. Security controls are also processes and actions. Your actions are in
fact one of the most important security controls to protect your assets and mitigate
threats and adversaries.
The outcome of suitable security processes, actions, and technology, is the
protection of your assets, privacy, and anonymity.

Phishing

pulls attacks through email systems. The attacker crafts email that tries to deceive a victim into either opening a compromised attachment, or visiting a compromised website. The website may try to deceive the victim into downloading attacks or malware, or to deceive the victim into providing a user
name and password to the site.

Watering-hole attacks 

compromise a website and try to deceive either the victim or the victim’s browser into downloading malware.



Firewall

The question remains: what exactly is a
firewall? Firewalls are network devices or software that separates one
trusted network from an untrusted network (e.g., the Internet) by means
of rule-based filtering of network traffic as depicted in Exhibit 1-13.
Despite the broad definition of a firewall, the specifics of what makes

Proxy



Breach of Firewall

The most common way to breach a firewall is to deceive an insider at a targeted
organization into using their computer to pull an attack through the firewall:

Firewall vendors do what they can to design firewalls to detect and block these
attacks, but no such measures are perfect. Most mail servers, even firewall-protected
servers, accumulate some number of phishing emails every year. Most browsers
attempt to download malware on a regular basis. Encrypted communications are
often thought of as a means of addressing some firewall vulnerabilities, but
encryption provides no protection at all from phishing attacks. As a rule, this class
of attack is pulled right through encrypted connections to electronic mail servers
and compromised websites. Encryption is designed to provide protection against
so-called “man in the middle” attacks. When an endpoint of encryption is compromised,
such as a mail server containing attacks, or a website containing attacks,
encryption provides no protection at all.



Virtualization
Technology has advanced to the point that server consolidation through
virtualization can help tame the cost of infrastructure deployment and operation by reducing the number of servers required to perform the same level of operational standards, given that enterprises typically
underutilize the full capacity available in physical servers. This section
explores the history, concepts, and technologies of virtualization.

No 100% Security

First very important point, you cannot ever have 100% security, just like you can
never have zero risk. Therefore, you can never completely protect your assets or
maintain perfect privacy or have total anonymity.

Assessment

impact your reputation, your privacy, your anonymity? What would be the impact of
loss of privacy and anonymity? What is your adversary likely to do?
