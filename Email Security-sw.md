# Chapter 1: Why Do You Need Secure Email?

Karibu kwenye BarinyChuo, Kwenye kitabu hiki nitazungumzia usalama wa email zako. utajifunza jinsi ya kuifunga email inbox yako na kuifanya iwe salama 

# Umuhimu wa usalama wa email

Email ni chombo muhimu cha mawasiliano, mawasiliano binafsi au ya ofisi, mambo ya kawaida na siri

Email ndio inatumika kwenye ku reset password  ya huduma nying za mtandao kama umesahau au umepoteza, huduma hizo kuanzia za kibenki mpaka mitandao ya kijamii

Kwa hiyo utaona kwamba kwenye email yako kuna anuani za watu mbalimbali, simu za watu, taarifa mbali mbali

Ukweli ni kwamba muhalifu akifanikiwa kuingia kwenye email yako, hapo utakua umekaribisha balaa maana yake anakua na uwezo wa kuingia kwenye mitandao mingine pia. Maana anaweza kutumia hiyo email kubadilisha password zako nyingine na usiweze kuingia na yeye ndio akatumia akijifanya wewe. Hivyo anaweza kuleta madhara madogo na makubwa pia kama kufanya wizi au kukuabisha

Kwa bahati mbaya sana waliotengeneza huduma ya email hawakuwaka huduma ya ulinzi kwenye email mbali na password. Ukijumuisha makosa ya kibinadamu, spam na email phishing na hatari nyingine utanona kwamba kuna hatari nyingi sana kwenye email kuliko vile unavyofikiria


Furthermore, the constant barrage of security news—breaches, failings, vulnerabilities,
insecurities, and more—leads to dissonance. Simply put, we stop caring when there is too
much noise.
But email account security is serious. That’s why in this guide you are going to learn about:
‣ Why email encryption is important and why email isn’t secure.
‣ Common email security mistakes, spotting scam emails, and creating the perfect
password.
‣ Learn all about turning on 2FA, using a VPN, and how to check your email securely.
‣ How do you choose a secure email provider? How do you check your emails in public
securely?
‣ Different encryption types, including how to encrypt Outlook, whether to use OpenPGP,
and which emails you should encrypt.
‣ Can your instant messaging service safely replace your secure email account? And Is that
even practical?
You will find something new to learn in each section of this email security guide!

Email Encryption Is Important
Here’s something for you to consider.
Where is your email vulnerable? Like, the actual locations where your email is vulnerable to
compromise. There are four main locations when someone else can grab your email:
‣ Your devices. The device you read your email on, be that a smartphone, desktop, or so on.
‣ The network. The network means the internet connection you’re using to access your
email account.
‣ The server. The server is where emails move from your account to your recipients; an
online email server is also where your emails store so you can access them from anywhere,
on any computer.
‣ Your recipient device. The device your recipient is reading your email on.
Did you get all four? Within those four locations are the overwhelming majority of places
where a malicious party could access your email. The internet is more secure than ever before,
with most sites and services now using the more secure HTTPS standard rather than regular
HTTP. However, even with the additional security offered by HTTPS, wouldn’t you prefer an
additional layer of protection?
That’s where email encryption steps in. Just as sending an email has never been easier, adding
an extra layer of encryption to your mail is just as simple. Encryption essentially wraps your
email in a new layer of near-impenetrable data that stops a malicious party reading the
contents of your email. (I say “near-impenetrable” as encryption comes in different strengths,
encryption isn’t guaranteed to stay secure forever, and some encryption algorithms are
already vulnerable.)
For instance, if you send a regular email containing sensitive information, the email passes
through a series of servers. If an attacker has compromised the server, there’s a strong chance
they can read everything passing through the server. If you sent that same sensitive email with
a layer of encryption, the attacker would have very little chance of reading the contents due to
the difficulty of removing the additional security layer.
(You will learn more about encrypting your emails later in this guide.)
The stakes are high. The attacker is likely to move swiftly on to other, less secure emails rather
than attempting to attack and decrypt your private information. The effort isn’t worth it—
unless you are a very high worth individual, of course.
Email Isn’t Secure
Always remember one thing: your email account isn’t secure, so don’t assume it is. The
assumption of security is a major issue for all email users. The main email protocol (a protocol
is a set of rules that dictate how something acts, in this case, how email is sent across the
internet), SMPT (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), has no integrated security mechanisms.
Yup, that’s right. The main source of communication around the entire globe has no inherent
security.
Copyright © 2020 MakeUseOf. All Rights Reserved ®
Here’s an article regarding email security protocols if you would like to understand more.
Protocols are a little dry, but they do underpin your email security, so I would advise reading
the article for some interesting email security background information.
Of course, email providers and servers have security built-in. Over the years, it became
painfully obvious that using something as ubiquitous as email without security was bonkers.
Security varies between email providers and email clients, so don’t assume you are protected
—it might not be the case.
Furthermore, this illustrates why taking the time to encrypt your email is so important.
Before reading the next chapter:
‣ Take a look at the email security protocol article linked above.

Chapter 2: Do You Make These Common
Email Security Mistakes?
One of the biggest problems facing us as regular email users is something basic—something
that starts at home. That’s right; it’s us. The human connection is a constant thorn in the side
of security and tech companies. There is no counting for what an individual can and will click
on, or a weak password, or a poorly configured, insecure computer.
In this chapter, you’re going to learn about the most common email security mistakes---and
how you can avoid making them.
Do You Make These Common Email Security Mistakes?
When I say common email security mistakes, this is what I mean:
‣ Clicking on links in suspicious emails
‣ Poor spam filtering leading to an influx of malicious email
‣ Opening unsolicited email attachments
‣ Weak and reused passwords
How to Spot Suspicious Scam and Phishing Emails
According to Statista, over 280 billion emails are sent and received every day. Depending on
where you find your stats and definitions, spam email accounts for anywhere between 5
percent to 45 percent of all email sent every day. Statista puts this figure as high as 55
percent, whereas the 2018 Trustwave Global Security Report puts it as low as 39 percent.

Your inbox, then, is a hotbed of potential spam email. Within the dietary pills and Nigerian
Prince emails lurk another kind of issue. In amongst the spam are cryptocurrency blackmails,
extortion attempts, malicious invoices for regular internet services, and much more. However,
they’re not always easy to spot.
Don’t be downhearted. Just today I was sent a fake Amazon Prime invoice with a very similar
renewal date to my own, and I almost clicked it out of confusion. And that confusion is what
spammers, scammers and otherwise rely on. Casting doubt in the hope you click a link or
download a file you really shouldn’t.
There are five things you can do to quickly verify whether the email sent to you from Amazon,
Netflix, or your bank are the real deal.

1. Check the sender email address. Depending on the level of sophistication, the email
address won’t correlate to the institution allegedly sending it. If the sender email address
for a supposed bank notification is “awesomehotstuff76@hotmail.com” you should be in no
doubt that someone is attempting to scam you.
2. Grammar and Spelling. It is trivially easy to spoof the sender email address to match an
official account. The second major giveaway is the language and grammar in use. Are the
language and grammar accurate? Is your name and title correct? Does the language and
tone of the email sound strange? Misspellings, poor grammar, and completely incorrect
information are giveaways that something is afoot.
3. URGENT. What is the subject matter? Is it “URGENT: Your Account will XYZ”? Scammers
and spammers know the best way to get into your mind is to use uncertainty. The
uncertainty of an account in arrears, an unpaid bill, an outstanding old debt, or an
unexpected account renewal notice is enough to grab the attention of most users (see my
above experience with an Amazon phishing email for a prime example).
4. Attachments. Emails with unexpected attachments are a big red flag. A seemingly
harmless attachment can carry malware to infect your system.
5. Links. The same goes for an email hyperlink. Scammers set up phishing sites that mimic
login portals to steal your credentials. Don’t follow any links from an unsolicited email.
The list isn’t exhaustive. Scammers come up with new ways to trick unsuspecting users all the
time. Did you know that it takes around 12.5 million spam emails to get one response? It
sounds like a huge amount, but considering the billions of spam email sent every day, that still
means around 10,000 people every day lose their credentials, install malware, send money to
Nigeria, and respond to cryptocurrency scams.

MakeUseOf's Christian Cawley has some more tips on spotting malicious phishing emails,
with some handy examples, too.
Turn Up Your Spam Filter
Your email account has a spam filter. The filter checks incoming email from known spam
addresses, for spammy content, malicious attachments, and spammy subject matter bars and
sends it directly to your spam box.
Some filters are better than others. At other times, you need to tweak your spam filter settings
to block the rubbish before it hits your inbox. Here's how you tweak your filters in Gmail to
avoid unwanted incoming spam, while Outlook users can learn about adjusting their junk
filters right here.

Email Account Password
Modern life requires online accounts. Online accounts require passwords. Passwords require
attention because they’re key to stopping any attacker intruding into your account.
Password management is tricky, due to the number of accounts and the difficulty required to
create a strong enough unique password that you can actually remember. Deep down, in your
digital heart, you know that reusing your basic “hunter2” password is wrong. But it makes life
easy. The problem is that “hunter2” is a weak password that an attacker can crack in no time at
all.
So, what’s the key to making a secure, unique password?
To get started, consider the following:
‣ It must be longer than eight characters.
‣ It must not use any identifying information: birthdays, pet names, birthplaces, etc.
‣ Don’t use dictionary words; they’re too easy to match.
‣ You should use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
An ideal password looks like this:
‣ Zwb2=<UwrP77”?ra
‣ a%6HBT<*D[9>4z{p
‣ Z982eyG}`z%pF"N.
This is a completely random string of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols. It
has no link to my person at all, and is also 16 characters in length. It will take a password
cracker a long time to break through. Long enough that someone will give up and move onto
other, easier targets.
Use a Password Manager
The second biggest security boost you can give yourself and your email security is using a
secure password manager. A password manager securely stores your passwords. Depending
on the password manager, you copy your password across, or the password manager
automatically inserts the correct password for the account in question.
There are a fair few password management tools out there, so check out the MakeUseOf
guide to choosing the right password manager for your needs.
Before reading the next chapter:
‣ Check your inbox for any scam or spam emails (don’t click on them though!)
‣ Check your email provider and see what level your spam filter is set too.
‣ Think about your passwords; are they strong enough, and could you use a password
manager?

Chapter 3: How to Use Your Email Account
Securely
This chapter is all about accessing and using your email securely, be that in your home or while
connected to a free Wi-Fi connection in your favorite cafe.
How to Use Your Email Account Securely
More than 50% of all email is opened on a mobile device. Moreover, mobile email users check
their email around three times more than desktop users. In the hyper-connected world,
checking your email on the go is a simple yet effective productivity tip. It isn't even a
productivity tip; it is the easiest way to stay connected to family, friends, work, and everything
else in-between.
It is important, then, to keep all of your devices secure, be that a smartphone, laptop, tablet, or
desktop. Here are six things for you to consider:
‣ Make sure you set a secure device password. Your device password should not use a
birthday, phone number, or anything easily linked to you. Ideally, you can use a combination
of letters and numbers, like a proper password, or even a passphrase (an easily
remembered phrase is a much longer device key than a single word).
‣ Avoid unsecured free public Wi-Fi. Many places offer free public Wi-Fi for their clients or
guests. If you don't have to sign into the Wi-Fi network using a password, the connection is
insecure, and your internet traffic could be vulnerable to attack.
‣ Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). If you do have to use an unsecured free Wi-Fi
network, using a VPN is a vital security step. Using a VPN creates a private tunnel between
your device and the VPN provider server, making sure no one can snoop on your data.
‣ Regular antimalware scans. You can go to great lengths to use a secure email provider, but
it won't matter a jot if an attacker installs keylogging or credential-stealing malware on
your system. Scan your system regularly with Malwarebytes Antimalware (available for
Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android), or better yet, upgrade to the premium version for live
system protection. (Here are five excellent reasons to consider upgrading to
Malwarebytes Premium!)
‣ Update your system. Install system updates. Sure, they can arrive at inconvenient times,
but it is a smaller irritation than someone hacking your accounts with credentials stolen
directly from you.
‣ Turn on 2-Factor Authentication. 2-Factor Authentication, or 2FA, adds another security
layer to your account, sending a limited-use code to a separate device that you enter after
your password. There are tips on using 2FA in the next inbox security lesson.
‣ Add encryption. If your current email provider doesn't support additional encryption levels,
consider switching providers. If that isn't an option, a third-party encryption utility is what
you need.
About that last point, "Add encryption." You might note that I've not talked about third-party
encryption utilities. Oh, you guessed it; encryption tips and tools are covered soon!
Copyright © 2020 MakeUseOf. All Rights Reserved ®
Sign Up for a VPN
The third point on the how to check your email securely list above is “Use a Virtual Private
Network.” You might have already heard the term “VPN.” Many people use a VPN to access
video content in their native country when traveling abroad. That isn’t all VPNs are useful for,
though. A VPN is a handy and cheap (sometimes free, but more on that in a moment) way to
increase your security with very little effort. Here’s why:
‣ When you browse the internet, your device sends the data to your internet service provider
(ISP), and the ISP routes the data to the correct website. The ISP and the website know
where you are and in theory can read the data in transit. Whereas,
‣ A VPN creates a tunnel between your device and the VPN providers private server. All of
the traffic from your device routes through the VPN tunnel first before emerging from the
VPN provider server. You can choose the VPN server location, too, making your traffic
appear as it was coming from an alternative location.
The VPN tunnel is encrypted, protecting your data from any prying eyes between your device
and the VPN server.
However, a VPN doesn’t directly encrypt or secure your emails. Using a VPN isn’t like
encrypting an email directly within your email client or using a third-party encryption tool. Data
transiting between your device and the VPN server is private and secure, but once it leaves the
VPN server it is once again “in the wild.”
Use a Paid-For VPN Subscription
Now, I said “sometimes free.” Why only “sometimes,” you might wonder? Well, the old internet
adage goes “if you’re not paying for the product, you are the product.” It is a model we see with
Google, Facebook, and countless other free internet services. VPNs are no different. Truly
securing your connection does come at a small cost, and a paid VPN always trumps a free
one.
Copyright © 2020 MakeUseOf. All Rights Reserved ®
Luckily, there are numerous excellent VPN providers available that cost very little while
providing an exemplary service. MakeUseOf strongly recommends CyberGhost for their
commitment to privacy, performance, and flexibility. I use it myself!
That said, not all free VPNs are doom and gloom. Many free VPNs will absolutely do in a pinch,
offering a range of download options, server locations, and privacy settings. MakeUseOf’s Ben
Stegner has tested some of the best unlimited free VPNs you can lay your hands on, while
Christian Cawley regularly updates the MakeUseOf guide to the best VPNs, both paid and
free.
How Do I Use a VPN?
Once you decide on a VPN provider you will download their VPN software or app to your
device. Before checking your emails when connected to a free Wi-Fi connection, fire up the
VPN and connect to a secure server, then open your email account. Your traffic remains secure
from malice! Remember, you can use your VPN to encrypt your web traffic at all times, not just
when you use a public Wi-Fi connection.
Many of the staff at MakeUseOf use a VPN at all times for the additional security and privacy.
Before reading the next chapter:
‣ Think about the ways you can use email securely and how you currently check your inbox.
‣ Consider updating and improving your device password; This was covered earlier in the
guide.
‣ Sign up for a reputable VPN; be that a free VPN to figure out how they work or a paid
option, a VPN gives you an instant security boost.
‣ Check your system for updates. If you have a pending system update, save your work and
important documents, create a system restore point, then install it!
(Unsure about system restore points? Read “4. Enable Restore Point” in Joel’s article looking at
what you should do before every Windows Update. It is a great read with information for the
frequent updates!).

Chapter 4: How to Choose a Secure Email
Provider
This chapter is all about secure email providers: how you choose a provider, what the most
secure email clients are, how you enable 2FA account security, if you can stop scammers from
spoofing your email address, and why email security (like all cybersecurity) is similar to a really
delicious cake.
Choosing a Secure Email Provider
Choosing a secure email provider is easier than you think. There's a good reason for that.
Despite the numerous reports of breaches, vulnerabilities, hacks, and so on, the average
internet user has never been safer in the "modern" internet era.
There are numerous secure email providers out there. You have two questions to answer:
What level of protection do you need? And how much are you willing to pay? You want your
email client (the place you read your email) to be secure. You want your email to be secure in
transit, too, using powerful encryption to protect your information further. You also don't want
to break the bank, and in reality, you don't need to.
Several excellent secure email services offer end-to-end encryption for your emails. End-toend
encryption means protection for your email from the moment you hit send to the moment
your recipient opens it. (What happens on your recipient device is, as you read at the start of
this guide.)
Unfortunately, Outlook and Gmail don’t offer “end to end” encryption as standard. But, keep
reading to find out how you can add this functionality in Outlook—and why you cannot do the
same in Gmail.

1. ProtonMail
ProtonMail is a free, open-source encrypted email provider. ProtonMail has a web client and
apps for iOS and Android. How secure is ProtonMail? Well, unless your recipient has your email
password, they cannot open your email. At all, ever. Even ProtonMail cannot (and will not) open
your email, in any eventuality. Want another boost to your email security confidence?
ProtonMail is based in Switzerland, one of the single-best countries for protecting private user
data.
Unsure about switching from Gmail to ProtonMail? MakeUseOf's Editor in Chief Joel Lee takes
a closer look at which email provider is best for your needs.
2. Mailfence
Mailfence is an excellent, free webmail service that not only encrypts your emails, but any
calendars, notes, contacts, and documents you store using the service. All in all, for a free
Copyright © 2020 MakeUseOf. All Rights Reserved ®
service, Mailfence is up there with ProtonMail in bringing the power of encryption to anyone
that would like to try.
MakeUseOf likes Mailfence for more than its excellent encryption and security offering.
Mailfence owner and developer, ContactOffice, donates 15% of the income from their paid-for
Pro plan to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the European Digital Rights Foundation.
Furthermore, Mailfence is based in Belgium, renowned for its strong privacy laws.
3. Tutanota
A Tutanota free account comes with 1GB storage and excellent end-to-end encryption. A
premium account comes with extensive functionality, including sending Tutanota encrypted
mail to non-Tutanota email addresses. (You can send encrypted mail to non-Tutanota email
addresses with a free account, but you will have to arrange an alternative secure delivery
method for the password to unlock the email.)
MakeUseOf's James Frew reviews ProtonMail and Tutanota in his look at encrypted email
providers.
What is 2FA and How Do You Use It?
Two-factor authorization (2-FA) is an important additional email account security feature. 2FA
is a process which requires you to enter two different passwords to unlock your account.
The first password is your unique password, as previously covered. The second verification
password is usually a time-limited code that is sent to another device, although you can use a
fingerprint or other biometric scan in its place. The idea is that only the legitimate account
owner should have access to the second piece of verification data, drastically increasing
security.
For instance, when I log into my email account, I enter my secure password. Because I have 2-
FA turned on, moments later I receive a six digit code that I must enter into the login panel
before the code expires. Without the second code, my email account remains locked.
You might have already encountered 2-FA when using an online banking portal, using a card
reader or similar to create a one-time password to unlock your account. It isn’t just your online
banking that uses 2-FA—your email account can use it, too.
Copyright © 2020 MakeUseOf. All Rights Reserved ®
I don’t have the space available to detail how to turn on 2-FA for the most popular services.
However, I’m not leaving you hanging. Check out the following links to learn how to setup 2-FA:
‣ How to Protect Your Apple Account Using 2-FA
‣ The EFF’s short guide to using 2-FA with outlook.com
‣ Leo Laporte’s Quick 2-FA Setup Guides
Can You Stop Scammers Spoofing Your Email Address?
Last year, I received a surprising email. It was sent from my private email address back to the
same address, and I was advertising some variety of dietary pills. From myself, to myself. A
spammer was using my email address to send all kinds of irritating and potentially malicious
mail. In a short time, my legitimate outgoing emails began heading straight into the recipient's
spam box, filtered out because other people were (quite rightly) declaring my domain as a
source of spam.
So, can you stop spammers and scammers spoofing your domain?
The answer comes down to your email provider. If you have control over the domain you send
your email from, you can implement some of the measures in the linked article to stop a
spoofer using your email address.
However, if you use a free email provider, such as Gmail or Yahoo Mail, you have less control
over the additional security protocols your inbox uses. Don't take that the wrong way, though.
Google and other free email providers still have a vested interest in stopping spam mail and
email spoofing so using a free service doesn't automatically make you a bigger or easier spoof
target than other services.
Email Security is Delicious
Email security is like a gigantic, delicious cake. To truly secure your email account, you need
layers. A password, two-factor authentication, encryption, and a VPN are all vital layers in your
email security plan.
Before reading the next chapter:
‣ Follow one of the 2-FA guides to secure your email account.
‣ Check out the free encrypted mail services and consider signing up for one.
‣ Consider how many layers your security cake has and if you could add more.

Chapter 5: How to Encrypt Your Emails
In this chapter you'll learn about encryption: encryption in Gmail and Outlook, considering
third-party encryption utilities, and whether your emails need the additional security layer of
encryption.
Encryption in Gmail
Google takes email security and privacy seriously. Well, to an extent. Remember, if you’re not
paying for the product, you are the product. (It isn’t just you, there’s billions of us!) However, for
the most part, Gmail is a secure email service with enough functionality for the vast majority of
users.
Gmail uses TLS encryption by default, so long as the recipient email server supports it. If you're
sending email from and to a Google account, TLS is automatic. (TLS a basic-but-effective level
of encryption that many email services will use by default—see our article explaining email
security protocols for more information on TLS encryption.)
Only paid-for G Suite accounts can add a personal digital certificate to a Gmail account. (And
even then, your workplace or G Suite administrator may turn off such functionality.) If you have
a paid-for G Suite account, follow Step 3: Upload Certificates on the official Google how to
enable S/MIME tutorial.
Otherwise, if you use a free Gmail account, feel free to skip forward to the Third-Party
Encryption Tools section further down. It has some excellent third-party encryption tools that
work perfectly with a Gmail account!
Encryption in Outlook
Like Gmail, Microsoft Outlook will use TLS encryption where possible (if the email server
supports the encryption protocol).
Paid-for versions of Microsoft Outlook can upload a personal Digital Certificate to encrypt your
email. That means those with an Office 365 subscription or with a standalone Microsoft Office
license. Free versions of Microsoft Office Online and Outlook.com cannot install a personal
digital certificate. This is a slight irritation, but nothing to worry about because there are secure
third-party encryption tools—and you can check out three of the best down below.
Install Personal Digital Certificate in Outlook
Here's how you install a personal Digital Certificate in Outlook. The Digital Certificate will allow
you to sign and encrypt Outlook emails using S/MIME. However, your recipient must also
support S/MIME, or the message will fail to send.
1. Using Mozilla Firefox, head to Comodo's Install SSL site. (You cannot use Microsoft Edge or
Google Chrome for this task.)
2. Hit the large GET NOW button.
3. Enter the details for the email account you want to secure (that you use within Microsoft
Outlook). Add a password. Think back to the start of this guide regarding password
creation and strength. Accept the terms of the Subscriber Agreement and press Next, and
follow the on-screen instructions.
Copyright © 2020 MakeUseOf. All Rights Reserved ®
4. Head to your email account and open the Comodo collection email. Copy the link
highlighted in the image below and paste it into the Mozilla Firefox address bar and press
Enter. Enter your corresponding email address. Now, copy the Collection Password from
the email into the Collection Password field and press Enter. Your Digital Certificate should
immediately begin downloading (it will only take a second or two).
5. Next up, and still working within Mozilla Firefox, you need to extract the Digital Certificate
from the browser Certificate Store. Reason being that the automatically downloaded
certificate is in the wrong format. In Mozilla Firefox, head to Menu > Options > Privacy &
Security, then scroll down to the Security section and select View Certificates.
Copyright © 2020 MakeUseOf. All Rights Reserved ®
6. Select the Your Certificates tab, then select the Certificate Name for the relevant email
address, and press Backup. Select a relevant and memorable filename, then Save the file
to a memorable location. You must now create another password. This password is very
important. It protects the backup file you are creating, as well as serving as a password
when you install the Digital Certificate in another program.
Copyright © 2020 MakeUseOf. All Rights Reserved ®
7. Open Outlook. (I'm using Outlook 2016.) Head to File > Options > Trust Center > Trust
Center Settings > Email Security. Under Digital IDs, select Import/Export, then browse to
the location you saved the Digital Certificate backup, select it, then press Open. Now, enter
the backup password created in the previous step, and continue with default settings.
Copyright © 2020 MakeUseOf. All Rights Reserved ®
8. Now, under the Encrypted Email section, you can add your Default Setting, using the
Settings button to alter the level of encryption you add to each email.
As mentioned above, unless the person you are sending to also uses the same encryption
protocol as you, your outgoing email will see an error message.
And that is frustrating. Unfortunately, if your recipient doesn’t support incoming email
encrypted with S/MIME, you will have to use an alternative secure messaging tool. For
instance, the other email encryption methods listed below allow you to send an extremely
secure message, to anyone, regardless of their inbox encryption settings.

Third-Party Encryption Tools
Encryption requires a password. The person you are sending an email to must have a way of
unlocking your encryption. That is where public and private key cryptography comes to the
fore.
Before continuing with this section on third-party encryption tools, I strongly advise you read
section seven and eight of my article exploring 10 encryption terms you should know and
understand. It will make some of the upcoming information much easier to digest! Another
extremely informative read is this look at how encryption works and whether it is really safe.
So, third-party encryption tools for email come in two shapes and sizes: for your desktop, and
your browser. Desktop tools have the advantage of being multi-purpose, featuring Digital
Certificate managers, decryption tools, and so on. Browser encryption tools have the
advantage of being easy to use and normally have seamless integration with the service you
are trying to use.
When should use your encryption? Sending an email to your friend about her delicious apple
pie? You can send that without additional encryption. Sending an email to your friend
containing banking information? You should encrypt that email. You should encrypt emails
containing sensitive information. Traditionally sensitive information includes financial
information, passwords, personally identifying information, and otherwise.
Here are three third-party encryption tools you should check out, as well as where you should
use each tool.
1. OpenPGP
Okay, so OpenPGP is an open source encryption protocol that started life as Phil Zimmerman's
groundbreaking PGP (that stands for Pretty Good Privacy—yes, that's the actual name)
protocol. Zimmerman realized early on that the world needed a free, open-source encryption
protocol and at the time of writing, thousands of applications around the world use OpenPGP.
There are several handy OpenPGP implementations for home users like you and me.
‣ Windows: Windows users should check out Gpg4Win
‣ macOS: macOS users should check out GPGSuite
‣ Linux: Linux users should check out GnuPG
‣ Android: Android users should check out OpenKeychain
‣ iOS: iOS users should check out PGP Everywhere
The implementation found in each of these programs is slightly different (they all have
different developers putting the OpenPGP protocol to use encrypting your emails), but all are
reliable. The key takeaway from these encryption tools is that you can freely encrypt emails to
boost your security.
You can also email other users using OpenPGP standard tools, too. For instance, you could
email someone using one of the upcoming webmail encryption browser tools straight from
your OpenPGP enabled Outlook desktop client.

2. Mailvelope
Mailvelope is an easy to use browser extension for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
Mailvelope combines the "advantages of a cloud-based webmail solution . . . with OpenPGP
encryption."
It really is easy to use, working out of the box with webmail providers including Gmail, mail.ru,
Outlook.com, Yahoo, Zoho Mail, and volny.cz. Furthermore, Mailvelope has help pages and
support for GMX, Posteo, and WEB.DE.
3. FlowCrypt
FlowCrypt is another easy to use browser extension for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox
that lets you encrypt your Gmail traffic, both emails and files in transit. There is a beta Android
app still under development, and planned releases for macOS, iOS, and Linux, as well as client
add-ons for Thunderbird and Microsoft Outlook.
FlowCrypt integrates seamlessly with Gmail. Many users point to the ease of setup and overall
simplicity in comparison with other fully-featured encryption tools. However, unlike Mailvelope,
FlowCrypt only works with Gmail accounts, so bear that in mind.
Encryption Is Easy
Encryption doesn't have to feel overwhelming. The OpenPGP desktop and mobile
implementations may feel overwhelming to begin with. There are a huge number of online
resources that can guide you through the installation, setup, and overall use of each tool to
make sure your email remains secure at all times.
On the flip side, Mailvelope and FlowCrypt make sending encrypted emails to anyone simple.
Before reading the next chapter:
‣ Check out the free encrypted mail accounts, and consider signing up for one.
‣ Think about the third-party encryption tools and how they fit into your email routine.
‣ Consider which instant messaging apps you use and if you feel secure using them.
The final lesson is all about secure instant messaging tools: what are they, are they safe, and
can they truly replace an email account? Give a thought to the instant messaging tools you
use. Are you aware of their security features? Do you feel secure when you send a message?

Chapter 6: Are Instant Messaging Tools More
Secure Than Email?
This chapter is dedicated to instant messaging services. What is an instant messenger? Can
an instant messaging service replace your email account? And the key question: Are instant
messaging services secure?
What Is an Instant Messenger?
An instant messenger is a service where you can send a direct message instantaneously to a
contact. Contacts are usually friends, family, colleagues, and so on. Instant messengers have
been an extremely popular method of communication since the early days of the internet, with
modern instant messengers preceded by Internet Relay Chat (IRC), the Bulletin Board System
(BBS), and other classic chat programs such as ICQ, MSN Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger,
and others.
As for modern instant messengers? Think WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and other apps
that let you ping a message straight to your friend. Depending on the service, you can send
instant messages to and from your desktop, smartphone, tablet, and laptop.
Are Instant Messengers Secure?
There are several very secure instant messengers. One service, WhatsApp, is credited with
bringing end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to the masses. With over 1 billion users, the Facebookowned
encrypted messenger provides an extremely simple method for people to shield their
communication from prying eyes.
Copyright © 2020 MakeUseOf. All Rights Reserved ®
The fact that privacy destroying Facebook owns WhatsApp is beside the point, as the end-toend
encryption—that's encryption that protects your message from your device all the way to
your recipients—is secure. WhatsApp uses the Signal Protocol, as does Facebook Messenger's
Secret Conversation mode and more recently, Skype Private Conversations.
(Want to use Facebook Messenger Secret Conversation mode? MakeUseOf’s Dave Parrack
shows you how to enable Secret Conversation mode!)
Are instant messengers good to go then? Not quite. It really does depend on the platform.
‣ WhatsApp. Secured using the Signal Protocol, owned by Facebook. Also note that
automatic backups to Google Drive renders E2EE useless as the service cannot encrypt
the data once it leaves the service.
‣ Signal. The Signal Protocol developers, Open Whisper Systems, have a secure instant
messenger called Signal (using the same secure protocol).
‣ Telegram. Secured using an encryption scheme called MTProto and is owned by Pavel
Durov, the brother of the encryption protocol developer, Nikolai Durov. (The brothers also
developed the Russian version of Facebook, VK.) The Telegram encryption receives regular
criticism from encryption specialists for not being thoroughly tested as other encryption
algorithms, yet the messaging service is still banned in Russia and attracts regular criticism
from other governments.
‣ Wickr. Wickr is a popular E2EE messaging app that features the option for ephemeral
messages—that is, self-destructing messages on a timer. In 2017, Wickr turned its
encryption standard open-source, allowing anyone to make use of it and, most importantly,
any security researcher or cryptologist to examine it for vulnerabilities fully. As it turns out,
Wickr's end-to-end encryption is solid and will keep your messages safe.
‣ Threema. The Switzerland-based E2EE instant messenger bases its encryption on the
open-source NaCl standard and has passed multiple external security audits to confirm the
security on offer for your messages. Threema is the only app on this list with a small
upfront cost, but for that small outlay, you get an extremely secure, featureful E2EE
application.
How do you choose between the secure instant messaging apps? In my experience, that
decision is down to the people you communicate with. Threema is an excellent secure app, but
as none of my friends or family use it, I won't be using it either.

can.
Should You Use an E2EE Messenger Instead of Secure Email?
Deciding on the best method of secure conversation is difficult for everyday users and
businesses alike. The level of security offered by the secure instant messengers is substantial.
So substantial that numerous governments around the world want to ban their use. In
countries with authoritarian regimes, such as Russia, Iran, and China, many secure messaging
services are already banned and their use considered a crime against the government.
Alternatively, officials want the tech companies developing secure instant messengers to
create encryption "backdoors" that would allow a government official to see the contents of a
Copyright © 2020 MakeUseOf. All Rights Reserved ®
secure message. The idea that a developer could create a single-use backdoor is fanciful and
shows a considerable lack of understanding as to how encryption and secure messaging
services work.
Check out this MakeUseOf article if you'd like to understand why encryption backdoors are
dangerous.
The biggest difference between "regular" email encryption (e.g., TLS), an E2EE instant
messenger, and email using advanced encryption (e.g., third-party encryption) is how the
content of your message displays once received.
TLS encrypts your message content in transit, but once it hits your inbox, it displays in clear
text where anyone can read it. It is a similar situation with a secure instant messenger. The
message is secure with end-to-end encryption to protect from prying eyes in transit, but once
it arrives on your device, be that laptop, smartphone, or otherwise, the message will display in
cleartext.
It is here that certain third-party encryption tools hold a significant advantage over the
alternatives. Once a message hits your inbox, depending on the encryption utility you use, it
will not automatically display the contents until manually decrypted.
So, to answer the question, secure instant messengers are a fantastic, easy access utility that
provides secure communication for billions of people every day, without having to give
encryption, keys, passwords, and privacy much thought. But to replace secure email? Instant
messengers have some way to go.
Just to be clear:
‣ E2EE instant messages are excellent. You can use an E2EE message on a messaging app to
send any message encrypted in transit. However,
‣ An email secured using encryption is theoretically more secure than an E2EE message
because of the additional layers of security you can add.
What About Slack?
Slack is a messaging service for organizations. Each team member has an account and can
send a message to the rest of the users. Slack has been a revelation amongst messaging
services, offering enormous workplaces the opportunity to run a private internal messaging
service. It isn’t only for massive workplaces, though. My friends and I use a private Slack
channel to keep in touch, for instance.
The big question for many Slack users is “are my messages secure?” Unfortunately, the
answer is simple: They are not as secure as you would hope. In that, paid-for Slack chat
administrators can access and download the entire Slack chat history, including private chats.
If an administrator turns this feature on after the Slack channel is open, users will receive a
message informing them, but there is little a user can do other than rapidly delete messages
that must remain secure.
I wrote previously about how to use encryption tools with Slack, including the Shhhlack addon.
The add-on itself is very easy to use and does increase the security of Slack users, but not
every user will want to make the additional effort. Furthermore, some workplaces will find the
use of a third-party Slack encryption tool a direct offence and you could be on the receiving
end of a caution, or worse.

Here's what an encrypted WhatsApp message looks like to the sender:
Bringing E2EE to the Masses
There's no doubt that WhatsApp has a strong shout as the tool that truly brought easy end-toend
encryption to the masses. Whether every user understands the power of E2EE, or would
even care if they did realize is another question. The most important thing is that the option for
encryption is there for the moment people want to send a secure message.
Do you use a messaging service? Will you now switch to a more secure service? And would
you ever consider leaving email behind completely if an instant messaging tool could offer the
same functionality?

‣ Check out the other secure instant messenger services.
‣ Read about why encryption backdoors are a terrible idea and why encryption is extremely
important.
