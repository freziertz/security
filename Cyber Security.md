# CyberSecurity

Habari! Karibu kwenye somo letu 101 la usalama wa mtumiaji wa mwisho

Cybersecurity ni kitendo cha kulinda netowork, vifaa na taarifa dhidi ya mtu asiyeruhusiwa au waharifu na kuhakikihsa usili confidentiality, zinabaki kama zinavyotakiwa ziwe (integrity) na zinapatikana wakati wote zinapoitajika.

Kujilinda wewe mwenyewe dhidi ya uvamizi wa kimtandao (cyber attack) unaanza na uelewa na hatari zilizopo zinazo ambatana na shughuli za kihalifu wa kimtandao.

## Hatari za kuwa na usalama mdogo mtandaoni

Kuna hatari nyingi sana, baadhi ni kubwa na nyingine ndogo ndogo baadhi ya hizo hatari ni 

- Kifaa chako kinaweza ibiwa na waarifu, ukapoteza kifaa na taarifa muhimu
- waarifu wanaweza kuingia kwenye mtadao wa kazini kwako kupitia kifaa chako na kuleta madhala
- malware kufuta taarifa zote kwenye kifaa chako
- waharifu wanaweza kuharibu utu wako au taswila na heshima ya kazini au kwenye biashara yako
- Waarifu kuingia kwenye kifaa chako na kubadilisha baadhi ya mafaili
- Waarifu kutumia komputa yako kuwadhuru wengine kimtandao
- kukataliwa huduma fulani fulani (denial of service)
- kuiba utambulisho wako (impasonate)
- waarifu wanaweza kuiba taarifa za kadi yako ya benki (credit or debit card) na kufanya manunuzi mtandaoni

Kwa bahati mbaya sana hakuna njia kamilifu kwenye kuzuia uharifu wa kimtandao, hata kwa njia bora zilizopo sasa haziwezi kuzuia kwa asilimia mia moja ila kuna hatua ukichukua utambunguza uwezekano kwa kiasi kikubwa sana.

Vitu ambavyo unaweza kufanya kupunguza uhalifu mtandani

Kwanza unatakiwa ujielimishe kuhusu maswala mazima ya usama mtandaoni na uelewe vizuri hatari zilizopo jinsi ya kuzipunguza au kuzizuia

Tuangalie baadhi ya mananeno yanayoendana na Cyber security

- **Hacker, attacker, or intruder –** Haya maneno huwa wanayapewa wale watu wabaya wenye nia ya kuchunguza udhaifu wa software na computa kwa ujumla kwa manufaa yao.

- These terms are applied to the people who seek to exploit weaknesses in software and computer systems for their own gain. Although their intentions are sometimes benign and motivated by curiosity, their actions are typically in violation of the intended use of the systems they are exploiting. The results can range from mere mischief (creating a virus with no intentionally negative impact) to malicious activity (stealing or altering information).

- Malicious code – 

  Malicious code (also called malware) is unwanted files or programs that can cause harm to a computer or compromise data stored on a computer. Various classifications of malicious code include viruses, worms, and Trojan horses. (See

   

  Protecting Against Malicious Code

   

  for more information.) Malicious code may have the following characteristics:

  - It might require you to actually do something before it infects your computer. This action could be opening an email attachment or going to a particular webpage.
  - Some forms of malware propagate without user intervention and typically start by exploiting a software vulnerability. Once the victim computer has been infected, the malware will attempt to find and infect other computers. This malware can also propagate via email, websites, or network-based software.
  - Some malware claims to be one thing, while in fact doing something different behind the scenes. For example, a program that claims it will speed up your computer may actually be sending confidential information to a remote intruder.
     

- **Vulnerabilities –** Vulnerabilities are flaws in software, firmware, or hardware that can be exploited by an attacker to perform unauthorized actions in a system. They can be caused by software programming errors. Attackers take advantage of these errors to infect computers with malware or perform other malicious activity.

To minimize the risks of cyberattacks, follow basic cybersecurity best practices:

- **Keep software up to date.** Install software patches so that attackers cannot take advantage of known problems or vulnerabilities. Many operating systems offer automatic updates. If this option is available, you should enable it. (see [Understanding Patches and Software Updates](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-006) for more information.)
- **Run up-to-date antivirus software.** A reputable antivirus software application is an important protective measure against known malicious threats. It can automatically detect, quarantine, and remove various types of malware. Be sure to enable automatic virus definition updates to ensure maximum protection against the latest threats. Note: Because detection relies on signatures—known patterns that can identify code as malware—even the best antivirus will not provide adequate protections against new and advanced threats, such as zero-day exploits and polymorphic viruses.
- **Use strong passwords.** Select passwords that will be difficult for attackers to guess, and use different passwords for different programs and devices. It is best to use long, strong passphrases or passwords that consist of at least 16 characters. (See [Choosing and Protecting Passwords](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002).)
- **Change default usernames and passwords.** Default usernames and passwords are readily available to malicious actors. Change default passwords, as soon as possible, to a sufficiently strong and unique password.
- **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).** Authentication is a process used to validate a user’s identity. Attackers commonly exploit weak authentication processes. MFA uses at least two identity components to authenticate a user’s identity, minimizing the risk of a cyberattacker gaining access to an account if they know the username and password. (See [Supplementing Passwords](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST05-012).)
- **Weke firewall**. Firwall ina uwezo wa kuzuia aina fulani ya uvamizi kwa kuzuia misafara ya waharifu kabla haijaingia kwenye computa yako na pia kuzuia misafara isiyo hitajika kwenye komputa yako. Kuna baadhi ya operating system zina firewall. Kitu unachotakiwa ni kuruhusu na kufanya setting za firewall kama zilivyo elezwa kwenye maelekezo ya kifaa chako.
- 
- **Install a firewall.** Firewalls may be able to prevent some types of attack vectors by blocking malicious traffic before it can enter a computer system, and by restricting unnecessary outbound communications. Some device operating systems include a firewall. Enable and properly configure the firewall as specified in the device or system owner’s manual. (See [Understanding Firewalls for Home and Small Office Use](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-004).)
- **Be suspicious of unexpected emails.** Phishing emails are currently one of the most prevalent risks to the average user. The goal of a phishing email is to gain information about you, steal money from you, or install malware on your device. Be suspicious of all unexpected emails. (See [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014).)
